# Start the client & server 


  This is the root directory of the app contaning client and server.
  I have integrated docker containerization  with this application. 

  
  

### Docker commands

  

Assuming that there is docker installed and running in the local machine, run the following docker commands to start both client and server  in seperate container while cummunicating to each other.

Clone the repository
run from root where docker-compose.yml file is located

```sh
$ docker-compose up

```
to stop and clean-up the containers  run :
```
docker-compose down
```

# Frontend

  
  
  

The frontend UI is created with react and other helper libraries

  
### Some overview
- The idea was building a minimalistic UI with React and semantic-ui-react along with custom components.
- There are still lot to improve in term of Ux
- I used inline styling and stylesheet in this rather simple react apps. I usually prefer css modules and styled component for bigger projects.

  
  

### Tech

  

The following techs are used in the frontend

  

* [React js] as primary a view library
* [axios] for ajax handling requests

* [Redux]-for handling state management

* [Redux-saga] - for async side effects handling via redux action

* [semantic-ui-react]- great UI lib for modern web apps
